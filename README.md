# Running Image Classification with CLIP Model in Google Colab

This repository contains code to perform image classification using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model provided by OpenAI. Follow the steps below to run this code in Google Colab.

## Getting Started

1. **Open Google Colab**: Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

2. **Create a New Notebook**: Click on "File" in the top left corner, then select "New notebook" to create a new notebook.

3. **Install Required Libraries**: Run the following cell in the notebook to install the necessary libraries.

    ```python
    !pip install transformers torch
    ```

4. **Copy and Paste the Code**: Copy the code from the `clip_image_classification.ipynb` notebook in this repository and paste it into the cells of the Google Colab notebook.

5. **Run the Code**: Run each cell of the notebook sequentially. You can do this by clicking the play button next to each cell or by pressing `Shift + Enter`.

6. **View the Results**: Once the code has finished executing, you will see the image classification results printed in the notebook.

## Note

- The code provided in this repository performs image classification using a pre-trained CLIP model on a sample set of images from the COCO dataset. You can modify the `image_urls` and `classes` variables to perform classification on your own images with custom classes.

- Make sure to have a stable internet connection while running the code, as it requires downloading the CLIP model and processing images from external URLs.
